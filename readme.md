# Diabetes Prediction with Machine Learning

This project was developed as part of a module on solving real-world problems using programming and machine learning. The goal is to build a predictive model capable of determining the presence of diabetes in patients based on their physical characteristics and clinical measurements.

## Objective

Develop a supervised learning model that uses historical data to predict whether a patient has diabetes. This model will be trained with a dataset containing information such as age, weight, height, and other clinical variables.

## Features

- **Predictive Model Training:** Utilizes supervised learning algorithms to train the model.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizations and statistics to better understand the relationships between features.
- **Diabetes Prediction:** Based on new information provided by the user.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
